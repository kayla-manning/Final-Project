# Undergraduate Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) Traffic Patterns in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 

This project explores swipe counts for every day, location, and meal for the undergraduate HUDS facilities over the duration of the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. Dining patterns did shift toward closer dining halls and FlyBy between the two academic years, likely as a result of the increased time pressure at meal times under the new class schedule for the 2018-2019 academic year. Some findings, for example, include that River Central Houses appear to have much higher interhouse traffic compared to River West, and Currier is by far the most popular dining hall in the Quad.  My app includes visualizations to help better illustrate student dining patterns between houses, meals, academic years, and more.
